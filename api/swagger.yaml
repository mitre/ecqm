  title: eCQM REST API
  description: |
    This API provides services to describing and calculating electronic clinical
    quality measures.

    The API allows clients to get a list of all clinical quality measures the
    system currently has loaded. Individual measures may be retrieved by HQMF
    id. Clients may use measure information to create user interfaces or to
    request new clinical quality measure calculations.

    Measure calculations are created through the Quality Report services. To
    start a measure calculation, clients should POST to the QualityReport
    endpoint. If the measure has already been calculated, it will be returned
    with the results populates and the status.state property set to "completed".
    If the measure has not yet been calculated, the state of the returned
    QualityReport will be "requested". Using the id property returned when
    creating the QualityReport, clients can poll the /QualityReport/{id}
    endpoint with GET requests until measure calculation has completed.
